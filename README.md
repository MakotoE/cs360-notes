# Operating systems
- Virtualization
  - Conversion of a physical resource into a virtual form
  - The OS is a resource manager
  - Virtualization of CPU: Processes allow many programs to run, despite a limited number of CPUs
  - Virtualization of memory: Each process is assigned a virtual address space that maps to a physical space
- Concurrency
  - Multi-threadding allows many threads to run at the same time
- Persistence
  - System memory in DRAM is volatile and is erased when power is lost
  - Data in hard drives or SSDs are persistent
- System calls
  - The difference between routine procedure calls and system calls is that system calls change privilege levels
  - The user mode is restricted, while kernel mode grants more privileges
  - A trap transfers control to a trap handler which raises the privilege level
  - Return-from-trap reverts back to user mode
