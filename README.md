# Operating systems
- Virtualization
  - Conversion of a physical resource into a virtual form
  - The OS is a resource manager
  - Virtualization of CPU: Processes allow many programs to run, despite a limited number of CPUs
  - Virtualization of memory: Each process is assigned a virtual address space that maps to a physical space
- Concurrency
  - Multi-threadding allows many threads to run at the same time
- Persistence
  - System memory in DRAM is volatile and is erased when power is lost
  - Data in hard drives or SSDs are persistent
- System calls
  - The difference between routine procedure calls and system calls is that system calls change privilege levels
  - The user mode is restricted, while kernel mode grants more privileges
  - A trap transfers control to a trap handler which raises the privilege level
  - Return-from-trap reverts back to user mode

# Processes
- A process is a running program
- The OS virtualizes the CPU so that CPU time can be shared among running processes
- Policy: A ruleset for making decisions
- Scheduling policy: A policy for deciding which process gets to run on the CPU in a given moment
- Process API
  - Create
    - Allocates resources and starts a process
    - Processes are loaded in a lazy fasion, meaning programs are loaded when needed
    - Memory space is allocated for the process
    - 3 file descriptors are opened for a process: standard in, out, error
  - Destroy: Stops and deallocates a process
  - Wait: Wait for a process to stop
  - Miscellaneous control: Other controls, such as suspending a process
  - Status: How long a process has been running, what state it is in, etc.
- Process states
  - Running: Executing instructions
  - Ready: A process is ready to run but it is on hold
  - Blocked: The process is waiting for an event, such as file I/O
- The list of processes are contained in a process list
  - Each entry contains a process control block which has the context for each process
